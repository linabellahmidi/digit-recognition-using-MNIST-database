# digit-recognition-using-MNIST-database

This project endeavors to achieve precise digit recognition through the exploration of the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database. Curated from a diverse set of sources, including Census Bureau employees and high school students, the dataset comprises 60,000 meticulously curated training digits and 10,000 testing digits. Each digit has been thoughtfully size-normalized and centered within a fixed-size image measuring 28 Ã— 28 pixels.

In this comprehensive undertaking, various sophisticated methods are employed to unravel the intricacies of the dataset. The initial phase involves the application of linear regression, support vector machine, multinomial regression (softmax), principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, as well as the utilization of polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels. This extensive evaluation seeks to discern the most effective approach for digit recognition.

The subsequent phase of the project introduces the formidable power of neural networks. Leveraging the robust capabilities of PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework, a neural network is employed to classify MNIST digits. PyTorch's advanced features and flexibility contribute to the superior performance observed in this critical second part of the project.
